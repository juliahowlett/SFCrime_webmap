Web app:  Crime in San Francisco - March 1 - 8, 2024

This interactive map was created in QGIS and exported as a web app using the qgis2web plugin. Data points are clustered when zoomed out, showing the number of incidents in close proximity.  This gives a quick insight into hot spots for crime, as well as keeping the map legible.  Zooming in reveals distinct incidents. Hover over an incident to see details of each.  You can also search for an address.
The data was downloaded from DataSF open data portal.
